# Google Play Music API Written in C Sharp (C\#)

# PROJECT DEAD - Google Blocked.
Google as blocked any packet tracing / decrypting from their mobile app, preventing me to continue updating this API. I have been unsuccessful in bypassing this protection, and don’t see it becoming something I can do in my spare time anymore… Sorry for any inconveniences.

```
// ### Login ###
var mobileClient = new MobileClient();
if (await mc.LoginAsync("iAmARandom@gmail.com" /* can also be "iAmARandom" */, "randomPassword1"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Logged In!");

    // ### Get Listen Now Situations (What you see when you first open the app) ###
    ListListenNowSituationResponse listenNowSituations = await mc.ListListenNowSituationsAsync();

    // ... Get Data from listen Now Situations ...

    Track track = /*  collected track from something */;

    // ### Get Stream Url ###
    Uri url = await mc.GetStreamUrlAsync(track);

    // ... Do what ever you want with stream URI ...
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Login Failed!");
